# Online Catalogue Program

# How To Run

Download all files from the repository. You can either pull the files from the repository, or copy each file individually. 
You must make sure that app.py is in the Backend folder, and dashboard.html, index.html, script.js, and style.css are in the Frontend folder.

Open the command line at the directory you downloaded the files into, and run the command **make** to download all python requirements.

Run frontendgui.py. You can run it from a terminal/command line using **python frontendgui.py** or **make run**, open the file in your desired code editor and run from there.
